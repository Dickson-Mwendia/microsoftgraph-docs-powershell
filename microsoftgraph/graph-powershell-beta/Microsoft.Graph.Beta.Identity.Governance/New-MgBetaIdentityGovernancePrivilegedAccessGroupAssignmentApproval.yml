  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphApproval>`: approval
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Steps <IMicrosoftGraphApprovalStep[]>]`: Used to represent the decision associated with a single step in the approval process configured in approvalStage.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[AssignedToMe <Boolean?>]`: Indicates whether the step is assigned to the calling user to review. Read-only.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The label provided by the policy creator to identify an approval step. Read-only.
      - `[Justification <String>]`: The justification associated with the approval step decision.
      - `[ReviewResult <String>]`: The result of this approval record. Possible values include: NotReviewed, Approved, Denied.
      - `[ReviewedBy <IMicrosoftGraphIdentity>]`: identity
        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
        - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the identity. Note that this might not always be available or up to date. For example, if a user changes their display name, the API might show the new value in a future response, but the items associated with the user won't show up as having changed when using delta.
        - `[Id <String>]`: Unique identifier for the identity.
      - `[ReviewedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The date and time when a decision was recorded. The date and time information uses ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z. Read-only.
      - `[Status <String>]`: The step status. Possible values: InProgress, Initializing, Completed, Expired. Read-only.

  `STEPS <IMicrosoftGraphApprovalStep[]>`: Used to represent the decision associated with a single step in the approval process configured in approvalStage.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AssignedToMe <Boolean?>]`: Indicates whether the step is assigned to the calling user to review. Read-only.
    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The label provided by the policy creator to identify an approval step. Read-only.
