  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphAppConsentRequest>`: appConsentRequest
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AppDisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the app for which consent is requested. Required. Supports $filter (eq only) and $orderby.
    - `[AppId <String>]`: The identifier of the application. Required. Supports $filter (eq only) and $orderby.
    - `[ConsentType <String>]`: The consent type of the request. Possible values are: Static and Dynamic. These represent static and dynamic permissions, respectively, requested in the consent workflow. Supports $filter (eq only) and $orderby. Required.
    - `[PendingScopes <IMicrosoftGraphAppConsentRequestScope[]>]`: A list of pending scopes waiting for approval. This is empty if the consentType is Static. Required.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The name of the scope.
    - `[UserConsentRequests <IMicrosoftGraphUserConsentRequest[]>]`: A list of pending user consent requests. Supports $filter (eq).
      - `[ApprovalId <String>]`: The identifier of the approval of the request.
