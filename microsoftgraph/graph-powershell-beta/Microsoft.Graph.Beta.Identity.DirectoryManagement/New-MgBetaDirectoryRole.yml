    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Description <String>]`: The description for the directory role. Read-only. Supports $filter (eq), $search, $select.

        - `[Id <String>]`: Unique identifier for the identity.

  `MEMBERS <IMicrosoftGraphDirectoryObject[]>`: Users that are members of this directory role. HTTP Methods: GET, POST, DELETE. Read-only. Nullable. Supports $expand.

    - `[RoleMemberInfo <IMicrosoftGraphIdentity>]`: identity
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the identity. Note that this might not always be available or up to date.
