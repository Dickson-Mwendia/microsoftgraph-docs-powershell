  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphUserExperienceAnalyticsDeviceScores>`: The user experience analytics device scores entity consolidates the various Endpoint Analytics scores.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AppReliabilityScore <Double?>]`: Indicates a score calculated from application health data to indicate when a device is having problems running one or more applications. Valid values range from 0-100. Value -1 means associated score is unavailable. A higher score indicates a healthier device. Read-only. Valid values -1.79769313486232E+308 to 1.79769313486232E+308
    - `[BatteryHealthScore <Double?>]`: Indicates a calulated score indicating the health of the device's battery. Valid values range from 0-100. Value -1 means associated score is unavailable. A higher score indicates a healthier device. Read-only. Valid values -1.79769313486232E+308 to 1.79769313486232E+308
    - `[DeviceName <String>]`: The name of the device. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[EndpointAnalyticsScore <Double?>]`: Indicates a weighted average of the various scores. Valid values range from 0-100. Value -1 means associated score is unavailable. A higher score indicates a healthier device. Read-only. Valid values -1.79769313486232E+308 to 1.79769313486232E+308
    - `[HealthStatus <UserExperienceAnalyticsHealthState?>]`: userExperienceAnalyticsHealthState
    - `[Manufacturer <String>]`: The manufacturer name of the device. Examples: Microsoft Corporation, HP, Lenovo. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[Model <String>]`: The model name of the device. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[StartupPerformanceScore <Double?>]`: Indicates a weighted average of boot score and logon score used for measuring startup performance. Valid values range from 0-100. Value -1 means associated score is unavailable. A higher score indicates a healthier device. Read-only. Valid values -1.79769313486232E+308 to 1.79769313486232E+308
    - `[WorkFromAnywhereScore <Double?>]`: Indicates a weighted score of the work from anywhere on a device level. Valid values range from 0-100. Value -1 means associated score is unavailable. A higher score indicates a healthier device. Read-only. Valid values -1.79769313486232E+308 to 1.79769313486232E+308
