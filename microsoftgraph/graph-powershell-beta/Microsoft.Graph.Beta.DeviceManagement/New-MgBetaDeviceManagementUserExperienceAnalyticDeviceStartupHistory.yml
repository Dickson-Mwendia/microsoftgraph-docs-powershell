  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphUserExperienceAnalyticsDeviceStartupHistory>`: The user experience analytics device startup history entity contains device boot performance history details.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[CoreBootTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The device core boot time in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[CoreLoginTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The device core login time in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[DeviceId <String>]`: The Intune device id of the device. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[FeatureUpdateBootTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The impact of device feature updates on boot time in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[GroupPolicyBootTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The impact of device group policy client on boot time in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[GroupPolicyLoginTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The impact of device group policy client on login time in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[IsFeatureUpdate <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, indicates the device boot record is associated with feature updates. When FALSE, indicates the device boot record is not associated with feature updates. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[IsFirstLogin <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, indicates the device login is the first login after a reboot. When FALSE, indicates the device login is not the first login after a reboot. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[OperatingSystemVersion <String>]`: The user experience analytics device boot record's operating system version. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[ResponsiveDesktopTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The time for desktop to become responsive during login process in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[RestartCategory <UserExperienceAnalyticsOperatingSystemRestartCategory?>]`: Operating System restart category.
    - `[RestartFaultBucket <String>]`: OS restart fault bucket. The fault bucket is used to find additional information about a system crash. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[RestartStopCode <String>]`: OS restart stop code. This shows the bug check code which can be used to look up the blue screen reason. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[StartTime <DateTime?>]`: The device boot start time. The value cannot be modified and is automatically populated when the device performs a reboot. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2022 would look like this: '2022-01-01T00:00:00Z'. Returned by default. Read-only.
    - `[TotalBootTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The device total boot time in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
    - `[TotalLoginTimeInMS <Int32?>]`: The device total login time in milliseconds. Supports: $select, $OrderBy. Read-only.
