  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  BODYPARAMETER `<IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRbacApplication>`: unifiedRbacApplication
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[ResourceNamespaces <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRbacResourceNamespace1[]>]`: Resource that represents a collection of related actions.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[Name <String>]`: Name of the resource namespace. Typically, the same name as the id property, such as microsoft.aad.b2c. Required. Supports $filter (eq, startsWith).
      - `[ResourceActions <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRbacResourceAction1[]>]`: Operations that an authorized principal are allowed to perform.
        - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
        - `[ActionVerb <String>]`: HTTP method for the action, such as DELETE, GET, PATCH, POST, PUT, or null. Supports $filter (eq) but not for null values.
        - `[AuthenticationContextId <String>]`: 
        - `[Description <String>]`: Description for the action. Supports $filter (eq).
