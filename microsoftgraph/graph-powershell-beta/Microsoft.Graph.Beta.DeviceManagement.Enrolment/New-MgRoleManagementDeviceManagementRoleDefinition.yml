  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  BODYPARAMETER `<IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleDefinition>`: unifiedRoleDefinition
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AllowedPrincipalTypes <String>]`: allowedRolePrincipalTypes
    - `[Description <String>]`: The description for the unifiedRoleDefinition. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true.
    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name for the unifiedRoleDefinition. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true. Required.  Supports $filter (eq and startsWith operators only).
    - `[InheritsPermissionsFrom <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleDefinition[]>]`: Read-only collection of role definitions that the given role definition inherits from. Only Azure AD built-in roles support this attribute.
    - `[IsBuiltIn <Boolean?>]`: Flag indicating if the unifiedRoleDefinition is part of the default set included with the product or custom. Read-only.  Supports $filter (eq operator only).
    - `[IsEnabled <Boolean?>]`: Flag indicating if the role is enabled for assignment. If false the role is not available for assignment. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true.
    - `[ResourceScopes <String[]>]`: List of scopes permissions granted by the role definition apply to. Currently only / is supported. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true. DO NOT USE. This will be deprecated soon. Attach scope to role assignment
    - `[RolePermissions <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRolePermission[]>]`: List of permissions included in the role. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true. Required.
      - `[AllowedResourceActions <String[]>]`: Set of tasks that can be performed on a resource. Required.
      - `[Condition <String>]`: Optional constraints that must be met for the permission to be effective. Not supported for custom roles.
      - `[ExcludedResourceActions <String[]>]`: Set of tasks that may not be performed on a resource. Not yet supported.
    - `[TemplateId <String>]`: Custom template identifier that can be set when isBuiltIn is false. This identifier is typically used if one needs an identifier to be the same across different directories. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true.
    - `[Version <String>]`: Indicates version of the unifiedRoleDefinition. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true.

  INHERITSPERMISSIONSFROM <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleDefinition\[]>: Read-only collection of role definitions that the given role definition inherits from. Only Azure AD built-in roles support this attribute.
