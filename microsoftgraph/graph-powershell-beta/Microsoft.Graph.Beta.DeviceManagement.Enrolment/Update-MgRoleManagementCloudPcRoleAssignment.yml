  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  APPSCOPES <IMicrosoftGraphAppScope\[]>: Read-only collection with details of the app specific scopes when the assignment scopes are app specific. Containment entity. Read-only.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Provides the display name of the app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes since appScopeId is often an immutable, non-human-readable id. Read-only.
    - `[Type <String>]`: Describes the type of app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes, so a user interface can convey to the user the kind of app specific resource represented by the app scope. Read-only.

  BODYPARAMETER `<IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple>`: unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AppScopeIds <String[]>]`: Ids of the app specific scopes when the assignment scopes are app specific. The scopes of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. Directory scopes are shared scopes stored in the directory that are understood by multiple applications. Use / for tenant-wide scope. App scopes are scopes that are defined and understood by this application only.
    - `[AppScopes <IMicrosoftGraphAppScope[]>]`: Read-only collection with details of the app specific scopes when the assignment scopes are app specific. Containment entity. Read-only.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Provides the display name of the app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes since appScopeId is often an immutable, non-human-readable id. Read-only.
      - `[Type <String>]`: Describes the type of app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes, so a user interface can convey to the user the kind of app specific resource represented by the app scope. Read-only.
    - `[Condition <String>]`: 
    - `[Description <String>]`: Description of the role assignment.
    - `[DirectoryScopeIds <String[]>]`: Ids of the directory objects representing the scopes of the assignment. The scopes of an assignment determine the set of resources for which the principals have been granted access.
