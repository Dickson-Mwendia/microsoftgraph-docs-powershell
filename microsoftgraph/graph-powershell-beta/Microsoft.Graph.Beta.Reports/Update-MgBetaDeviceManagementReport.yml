  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementReports>`: Singleton entity that acts as a container for all reports functionality.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[CachedReportConfigurations <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementCachedReportConfiguration[]>]`: Entity representing the configuration of a cached report
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[ExpirationDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Time that the cached report expires
      - `[Filter <String>]`: Filters applied on report creation.
      - `[LastRefreshDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Time that the cached report was last refreshed
      - `[Metadata <String>]`: Caller-managed metadata associated with the report
      - `[OrderBy <String[]>]`: Ordering of columns in the report
      - `[ReportName <String>]`: Name of the report
      - `[Select <String[]>]`: Columns selected from the report
      - `[Status <DeviceManagementReportStatus?>]`: Possible statuses associated with a generated report
    - `[ExportJobs <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExportJob[]>]`: Entity representing a job to export a report
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[ExpirationDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Time that the exported report expires
