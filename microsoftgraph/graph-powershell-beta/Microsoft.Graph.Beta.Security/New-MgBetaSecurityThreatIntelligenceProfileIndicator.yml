  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphSecurityIntelligenceProfileIndicator>`: intelligenceProfileIndicator
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Artifact <IMicrosoftGraphSecurityArtifact>]`: artifact
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Source <String>]`: indicatorSource
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[FirstSeenDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Designate when an artifact was first used actively in an attack, when a particular sample was compiled, or if neither of those could be ascertained when the file was first seen in public repositories (for example, VirusTotal, ANY.RUN, Hybrid Analysis) or reported publicly.
    - `[LastSeenDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Designate when an artifact was most recently used actively in an attack, when a particular sample was compiled, or if neither of those could be ascertained when the file was first seen in public repositories (for example, VirusTotal, ANY.RUN, Hybrid Analysis) or reported publicly.
