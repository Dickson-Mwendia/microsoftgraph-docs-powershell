  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `ACCESSRULES <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExchangeAccessRule[]>`: The list of device access rules in Exchange. The access rules apply globally to the entire Exchange organization
    - `[AccessLevel <DeviceManagementExchangeAccessLevel?>]`: Access Level in Exchange.
    - `[DeviceClass <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExchangeDeviceClass>]`: Device Class in Exchange.
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[Name <String>]`: Name of the device class which will be impacted by this rule.
      - `[Type <DeviceManagementExchangeAccessRuleType?>]`: Criteria which defines the type of device this access rule will apply to

  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExchangeOnPremisesPolicy>`: Singleton entity which represents the Exchange OnPremises policy configured for a tenant.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AccessRules <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExchangeAccessRule[]>]`: The list of device access rules in Exchange. The access rules apply globally to the entire Exchange organization
      - `[AccessLevel <DeviceManagementExchangeAccessLevel?>]`: Access Level in Exchange.
      - `[DeviceClass <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExchangeDeviceClass>]`: Device Class in Exchange.
        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
        - `[Name <String>]`: Name of the device class which will be impacted by this rule.
        - `[Type <DeviceManagementExchangeAccessRuleType?>]`: Criteria which defines the type of device this access rule will apply to

      - `[OverrideDefaultRule <Boolean?>]`: Override the default access rule when allowing a device to ensure access is granted.
    - `[DefaultAccessLevel <DeviceManagementExchangeAccessLevel?>]`: Access Level in Exchange.
    - `[KnownDeviceClasses <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExchangeDeviceClass[]>]`: The list of device classes known to Exchange
    - `[NotificationContent <Byte[]>]`: Notification text that will be sent to users quarantined by this policy. This is UTF8 encoded byte array HTML.

  `CONDITIONALACCESSSETTINGS <IMicrosoftGraphOnPremisesConditionalAccessSettings>`: Singleton entity which represents the Exchange OnPremises Conditional Access Settings for a tenant.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.

  `KNOWNDEVICECLASSES <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExchangeDeviceClass[]>`: The list of device classes known to Exchange
    - `[Name <String>]`: Name of the device class which will be impacted by this rule.
    - `[Type <DeviceManagementExchangeAccessRuleType?>]`: Criteria which defines the type of device this access rule will apply to
