  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphMobileThreatDefenseConnector>`: Entity which represents a connection to Mobile Threat Defense partner.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AllowPartnerToCollectIosApplicationMetadata <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, indicates the Mobile Threat Defense partner may collect metadata about installed applications from Intune for IOS devices. When FALSE, indicates the Mobile Threat Defense partner may not collect metadata about installed applications from Intune for IOS devices. Default value is FALSE.
    - `[AllowPartnerToCollectIosPersonalApplicationMetadata <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, indicates the Mobile Threat Defense partner may collect metadata about personally installed applications from Intune for IOS devices.

    - `[WindowsDeviceBlockedOnMissingPartnerData <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, inidicates that Intune must receive data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner prior to marking a device compliant for Windows. When FALSE, inidicates that Intune may make a device compliant without receiving data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner for Windows. Default value is FALSE.
    - `[WindowsEnabled <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, inidicates that data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner can be used during compliance evaluations for Windows. When FALSE, inidicates that data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner should not be used during compliance evaluations for Windows. Default value is FALSE.
    - `[WindowsMobileApplicationManagementEnabled <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, app protection policies using the Device Threat Level rule will evaluate devices including data from this connector for Windows. When FALSE, Intune will not use device risk details sent over this connector during app protection policies calculation for policies with a Device Threat Level configured. Existing devices that are not compliant due to risk levels obtained from this connector will also become compliant.
