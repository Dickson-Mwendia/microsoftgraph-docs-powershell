  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAcceptanceStatus>`: A termsAndConditionsAcceptanceStatus entity represents the acceptance status of a given Terms and Conditions (T&C) policy by a given user. Users must accept the most up-to-date version of the terms in order to retain access to the Company Portal.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AcceptedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: DateTime when the terms were last accepted by the user.
    - `[AcceptedVersion <Int32?>]`: Most recent version number of the T&C accepted by the user.
    - `[TermsAndConditions <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditions>]`: A termsAndConditions entity represents the metadata and contents of a given Terms and Conditions (T&C) policy. T&C policies' contents are presented to users upon their first attempt to enroll into Intune and subsequently upon edits where an administrator has required re-acceptance. They enable administrators to communicate the provisions to which a user must agree in order to have devices enrolled into Intune.
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
