  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `ASSIGNMENTS <IMicrosoftGraphCloudPcUserSettingAssignment[]>`: Represents the set of Microsoft 365 groups and security groups in Azure Active Directory that have cloudPCUserSetting assigned. Returned only on $expand. For an example, see Get cloudPcUserSettingample.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[CreatedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The date and time this assignment was created. The Timestamp type represents the date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 looks like this: '2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'.
    - `[Target <IMicrosoftGraphCloudPcManagementAssignmentTarget>]`: cloudPcManagementAssignmentTarget
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.

  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphCloudPcUserSetting>`: cloudPcUserSetting
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Assignments <IMicrosoftGraphCloudPcUserSettingAssignment[]>]`: Represents the set of Microsoft 365 groups and security groups in Azure Active Directory that have cloudPCUserSetting assigned. Returned only on $expand. For an example, see Get cloudPcUserSettingample.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[CreatedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The date and time this assignment was created. The Timestamp type represents the date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 looks like this: '2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'.
      - `[Target <IMicrosoftGraphCloudPcManagementAssignmentTarget>]`: cloudPcManagementAssignmentTarget
        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[CreatedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The date and time the setting was created. The Timestamp type represents the date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 looks like this: '2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'.
    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The setting name displayed in the user interface.
    - `[LastModifiedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The last date and time the setting was modified. The Timestamp type represents the date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 looks like this: '2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'.
    - `[LocalAdminEnabled <Boolean?>]`: Indicates whether the local admin option is enabled. Default value is false. To enable the local admin option, change the setting to true. If the local admin option is enabled, the end user can be an admin of the Cloud PC device.
    - `[RestorePointSetting <IMicrosoftGraphCloudPcRestorePointSetting>]`: cloudPcRestorePointSetting
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[FrequencyInHours <Int32?>]`: The time interval in hours to take snapshots (restore points) of a Cloud PC automatically. Possible values are 4, 6, 12, 16, and 24. The default frequency is 12 hours.
      - `[UserRestoreEnabled <Boolean?>]`: If true, the user has the ability to use snapshots to restore Cloud PCs. If false, non-admin users cannot use snapshots to restore the Cloud PC.
    - `[SelfServiceEnabled <Boolean?>]`: Indicates whether the self-service option is enabled. Default value is false. To enable the self-service option, change the setting to true. If the self-service option is enabled, the end user is allowed to perform some self-service operations, such as upgrading the Cloud PC through the end user portal.

  `RESTOREPOINTSETTING <IMicrosoftGraphCloudPcRestorePointSetting>`: cloudPcRestorePointSetting
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[FrequencyInHours <Int32?>]`: The time interval in hours to take snapshots (restore points) of a Cloud PC automatically. Possible values are 4, 6, 12, 16, and 24. The default frequency is 12 hours.
