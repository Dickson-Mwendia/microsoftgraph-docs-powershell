  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `AZUREADJOIN <IMicrosoftGraphAzureAdJoinPolicy>`: azureAdJoinPolicy
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[AllowedGroups <String[]>]`: The identifiers of the groups that are in the scope of the policy. Required when the appliesTo property is set to selected.
    - `[AllowedUsers <String[]>]`: The identifiers of users that are in the scope of the policy. Required when the appliesTo property is set to selected.
    - `[AppliesTo <String>]`: policyScope
