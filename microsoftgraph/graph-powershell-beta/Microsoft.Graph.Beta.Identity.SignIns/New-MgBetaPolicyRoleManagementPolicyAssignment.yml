  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleManagementPolicyAssignment>`: unifiedRoleManagementPolicyAssignment
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Policy <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleManagementPolicy>]`: unifiedRoleManagementPolicy
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[Description <String>]`: Description for the policy.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Display name for the policy.
      - `[EffectiveRules <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleManagementPolicyRule[]>]`: The list of effective rules like approval rules and expiration rules evaluated based on inherited referenced rules. For example, if there is a tenant-wide policy to enforce enabling an approval rule, the effective rule will be to enable approval even if the policy has a rule to disable approval. Supports $expand.
        - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
        - `[Target <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleManagementPolicyRuleTarget>]`: unifiedRoleManagementPolicyRuleTarget
          - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
          - `[Caller <String>]`: The type of caller that's the target of the policy rule. Allowed values are: None, Admin, EndUser.
          - `[EnforcedSettings <String[]>]`: The list of role settings that are enforced and cannot be overridden by child scopes. Use All for all settings.
          - `[InheritableSettings <String[]>]`: The list of role settings that can be inherited by child scopes. Use All for all settings.
          - `[Level <String>]`: The role assignment type that's the target of policy rule. Allowed values are: Eligibility, Assignment.
          - `[Operations <String[]>]`: The role management operations that are the target of the policy rule. Allowed values are: All, Activate, Deactivate, Assign, Update, Remove, Extend, Renew.
          - `[TargetObjects <IMicrosoftGraphDirectoryObject[]>]`: 
            - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
            - `[DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time when this object was deleted. Always null when the object hasn't been deleted.
      - `[IsOrganizationDefault <Boolean?>]`: This can only be set to true for a single tenant-wide policy which will apply to all scopes and roles. Set the scopeId to / and scopeType to Directory. Supports $filter (eq, ne).
      - `[LastModifiedBy <IMicrosoftGraphIdentity>]`: identity
        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
        - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the identity. Note that this might not always be available or up to date. For example, if a user changes their display name, the API might show the new value in a future response, but the items associated with the user won't show up as having changed when using delta.
        - `[Id <String>]`: Unique identifier for the identity.
      - `[LastModifiedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The time when the role setting was last modified.
      - `[Rules <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRoleManagementPolicyRule[]>]`: The collection of rules like approval rules and expiration rules. Supports $expand.

      - `[ScopeType <String>]`: The type of the scope where the policy is created. One of Directory, DirectoryRole, Group. Required.
    - `[PolicyId <String>]`: The id of the policy. Inherited from entity.
    - `[RoleDefinitionId <String>]`: For Azure AD roles policy, it's the identifier of the role definition object where the policy applies. For PIM for groups membership and ownership, it's either member or owner. Supports $filter (eq).
    - `[ScopeId <String>]`: The identifier of the scope where the policy is assigned.  Can be / for the tenant or a group ID. Required.
    - `[ScopeType <String>]`: The type of the scope where the policy is assigned. One of Directory, DirectoryRole, Group. Required.
