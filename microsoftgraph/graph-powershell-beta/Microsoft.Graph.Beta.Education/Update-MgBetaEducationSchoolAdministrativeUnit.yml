  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphAdministrativeUnit>`: administrativeUnit
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time when this object was deleted. Always null when the object hasn't been deleted.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Description <String>]`: An optional description for the administrative unit. Supports $filter (eq, ne, in, startsWith), $search.
    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Display name for the administrative unit. Supports $filter (eq, ne, not, ge, le, in, startsWith, and eq on null values), $search, and $orderBy.
    - `[Extensions <IMicrosoftGraphExtension[]>]`: The collection of open extensions defined for this administrative unit. Nullable.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[IsMemberManagementRestricted <Boolean?>]`: true if members of this administrative unit should be treated as sensitive, which requires specific permissions to manage. Default value is false. Use this property to define administrative units whose roles don't inherit from tenant-level administrators, and management of individual member objects is limited to administrators scoped to a restricted management administrative unit. Immutable, so cannot be changed later.  For more information about working with restricted management administrative units, see Restricted management administrative units in Azure Active Directory.
    - `[Members <IMicrosoftGraphDirectoryObject[]>]`: Users and groups that are members of this administrative unit. Supports $expand.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time when this object was deleted. Always null when the object hasn't been deleted.
    - `[ScopedRoleMembers <IMicrosoftGraphScopedRoleMembership[]>]`: Scoped-role members of this administrative unit.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[AdministrativeUnitId <String>]`: Unique identifier for the administrative unit that the directory role is scoped to
      - `[RoleId <String>]`: Unique identifier for the directory role that the member is in.
      - `[RoleMemberInfo <IMicrosoftGraphIdentity>]`: identity
        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
        - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the identity. Note that this might not always be available or up to date. For example, if a user changes their display name, the API might show the new value in a future response, but the items associated with the user won't show up as having changed when using delta.
        - `[Id <String>]`: Unique identifier for the identity.
    - `[Visibility <String>]`: Controls whether the administrative unit and its members are hidden or public. Can be set to HiddenMembership or Public. If not set, the default behavior is Public. When set to HiddenMembership, only members of the administrative unit can list other members of the administrative unit.

  `EXTENSIONS <IMicrosoftGraphExtension[]>`: The collection of open extensions defined for this administrative unit. Nullable.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.

  `INPUTOBJECT <IEducationIdentity>`: Identity Parameter
    - `[EducationAssignmentId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationAssignment
    - `[EducationAssignmentResourceId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationAssignmentResource
    - `[EducationCategoryId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationCategory
    - `[EducationClassId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationClass
    - `[EducationGradingCategoryId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationGradingCategory
    - `[EducationOutcomeId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationOutcome
    - `[EducationRubricId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationRubric
    - `[EducationSchoolId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSchool
    - `[EducationSubmissionId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSubmission
    - `[EducationSubmissionResourceId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSubmissionResource
    - `[EducationSynchronizationErrorId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSynchronizationError
    - `[EducationSynchronizationProfileId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSynchronizationProfile
    - `[EducationUserId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationUser

  `MEMBERS <IMicrosoftGraphDirectoryObject[]>`: Users and groups that are members of this administrative unit. Supports $expand.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time when this object was deleted. Always null when the object hasn't been deleted.

  `SCOPEDROLEMEMBERS <IMicrosoftGraphScopedRoleMembership[]>`: Scoped-role members of this administrative unit.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AdministrativeUnitId <String>]`: Unique identifier for the administrative unit that the directory role is scoped to
    - `[RoleId <String>]`: Unique identifier for the directory role that the member is in.
    - `[RoleMemberInfo <IMicrosoftGraphIdentity>]`: identity
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the identity. Note that this might not always be available or up to date. For example, if a user changes their display name, the API might show the new value in a future response, but the items associated with the user won't show up as having changed when using delta.
      - `[Id <String>]`: Unique identifier for the identity.
