### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Update the properties of an educationRubric object.
  Only teachers can perform this operation.
  Updating a rubric attached to an assignment (`PATCH /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/rubric`) is only possible before the assignment is published, and what is updated is actually the original rubric that exists under `/education/users/{id}/rubrics`.
  After the assignment is published, an immutable copy of the rubric is made that is attached to that specific assignment.
  That rubric can be retrieved using GET /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/rubric, but it cannot be updated.

  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphEducationRubric>`: educationRubric
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
