    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AssignmentResourceUrl <String>]`: Pointer to the assignment from which this resource was copied. If this is null, the student uploaded the resource.
    - `[Resource <IMicrosoftGraphEducationResource>]`: educationResource
