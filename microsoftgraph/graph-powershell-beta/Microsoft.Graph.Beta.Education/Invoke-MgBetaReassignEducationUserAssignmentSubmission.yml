### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Reassign the submission to the student with feedback for review.
  Only teachers can perform this action.
  Include the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` header when you call this method; otherwise, a reassigned submission will be treated as a returned submission.
  This means that the `reassigned` status will be mapped to the `returned` status, and **reassignedDateTime** and **reassignedBy** properties will be mapped to **returnedDateTime** and **returnedBy** respectively.
  If the header `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` is provided, a reassigned submission retains the `reassigned` status.
  For details, see the examples section.
