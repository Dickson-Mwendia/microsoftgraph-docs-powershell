  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `ACCEPTANCESTATUSES <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAcceptanceStatus[]>`: The list of acceptance statuses for this T&C policy.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AcceptedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: DateTime when the terms were last accepted by the user.
    - `[AcceptedVersion <Int32?>]`: Most recent version number of the T&C accepted by the user.
    - `[TermsAndConditions <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditions>]`: A termsAndConditions entity represents the metadata and contents of a given Terms and Conditions (T&C) policy. T&C policies' contents are presented to users upon their first attempt to enroll into Intune and subsequently upon edits where an administrator has required re-acceptance. They enable administrators to communicate the provisions to which a user must agree in order to have devices enrolled into Intune.
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[AcceptanceStatement <String>]`: Administrator-supplied explanation of the terms and conditions, typically describing what it means to accept the terms and conditions set out in the T&C policy. This is shown to the user on prompts to accept the T&C policy.
      - `[AcceptanceStatuses <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAcceptanceStatus[]>]`: The list of acceptance statuses for this T&C policy.
      - `[Assignments <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAssignment[]>]`: The list of assignments for this T&C policy.
        - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
        - `[Target <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceAndAppManagementAssignmentTarget>]`: Base type for assignment targets.
          - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[BodyText <String>]`: Administrator-supplied body text of the terms and conditions, typically the terms themselves. This is shown to the user on prompts to accept the T&C policy.
      - `[CreatedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: DateTime the object was created.
      - `[Description <String>]`: Administrator-supplied description of the T&C policy.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Administrator-supplied name for the T&C policy.
      - `[LastModifiedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: DateTime the object was last modified.
      - `[Title <String>]`: Administrator-supplied title of the terms and conditions. This is shown to the user on prompts to accept the T&C policy.
      - `[Version <Int32?>]`: Integer indicating the current version of the terms. Incremented when an administrator makes a change to the terms and wishes to require users to re-accept the modified T&C policy.
    - `[UserDisplayName <String>]`: Display name of the user whose acceptance the entity represents.
    - `[UserPrincipalName <String>]`: The userPrincipalName of the User that accepted the term.

  `ASSIGNMENTS <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAssignment[]>`: The list of assignments for this T&C policy.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Target <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceAndAppManagementAssignmentTarget>]`: Base type for assignment targets.
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.

  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditions>`: A termsAndConditions entity represents the metadata and contents of a given Terms and Conditions (T&C) policy.

They enable administrators to communicate the provisions to which a user must agree in order to have devices enrolled into Intune.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AcceptanceStatement <String>]`: Administrator-supplied explanation of the terms and conditions, typically describing what it means to accept the terms and conditions set out in the T&C policy. This is shown to the user on prompts to accept the T&C policy.
    - `[AcceptanceStatuses <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAcceptanceStatus[]>]`: The list of acceptance statuses for this T&C policy.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.

      - `[AcceptedVersion <Int32?>]`: Most recent version number of the T&C accepted by the user.
      - `[TermsAndConditions <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditions>]`: A termsAndConditions entity represents the metadata and contents of a given Terms and Conditions (T&C) policy. T&C policies' contents are presented to users upon their first attempt to enroll into Intune and subsequently upon edits where an administrator has required re-acceptance. They enable administrators to communicate the provisions to which a user must agree in order to have devices enrolled into Intune.
      - `[UserDisplayName <String>]`: Display name of the user whose acceptance the entity represents.
      - `[UserPrincipalName <String>]`: The userPrincipalName of the User that accepted the term.
    - `[Assignments <IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAssignment[]>]`: The list of assignments for this T&C policy.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[Target <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceAndAppManagementAssignmentTarget>]`: Base type for assignment targets.
