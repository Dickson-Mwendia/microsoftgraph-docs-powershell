  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphRoleDefinition>`: The Role Definition resource. The role definition is the foundation of role based access in Intune. The role combines an Intune resource such as a Mobile App and associated role permissions such as Create or Read for the resource. There are two types of roles, built-in and custom. Built-in roles cannot be modified. Both built-in roles and custom roles must have assignments to be enforced. Create custom roles if you want to define a role that allows any of the available resources and role permissions to be combined into a single role.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Description <String>]`: Description of the Role definition.
    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Display Name of the Role definition.
    - `[IsBuiltIn <Boolean?>]`: Type of Role. Set to True if it is built-in, or set to False if it is a custom role definition.
    - `[RoleAssignments <IMicrosoftGraphRoleAssignment[]>]`: List of Role assignments for this role definition.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[Description <String>]`: Description of the Role Assignment.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display or friendly name of the role Assignment.
      - `[ResourceScopes <String[]>]`: List of ids of role scope member security groups.  These are IDs from Azure Active Directory.
      - `[RoleDefinition <IMicrosoftGraphRoleDefinition>]`: The Role Definition resource. The role definition is the foundation of role based access in Intune. The role combines an Intune resource such as a Mobile App and associated role permissions such as Create or Read for the resource. There are two types of roles, built-in and custom. Built-in roles cannot be modified. Both built-in roles and custom roles must have assignments to be enforced. Create custom roles if you want to define a role that allows any of the available resources and role permissions to be combined into a single role.
    - `[RolePermissions <IMicrosoftGraphRolePermission[]>]`: List of Role Permissions this role is allowed to perform. These must match the actionName that is defined as part of the rolePermission.
      - `[ResourceActions <IMicrosoftGraphResourceAction[]>]`: Resource Actions each containing a set of allowed and not allowed permissions.
        - `[AllowedResourceActions <String[]>]`: Allowed Actions
        - `[NotAllowedResourceActions <String[]>]`: Not Allowed Actions.

  `ROLEASSIGNMENTS <IMicrosoftGraphRoleAssignment[]>`: List of Role assignments for this role definition.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[Description <String>]`: Description of the Role Assignment.
    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display or friendly name of the role Assignment.
    - `[ResourceScopes <String[]>]`: List of ids of role scope member security groups.  These are IDs from Azure Active Directory.
