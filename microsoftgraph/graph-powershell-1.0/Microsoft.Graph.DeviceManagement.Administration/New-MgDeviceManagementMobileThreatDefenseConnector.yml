  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphMobileThreatDefenseConnector>`: Entity which represents a connection to Mobile Threat Defense partner.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AllowPartnerToCollectIosApplicationMetadata <Boolean?>]`: When TRUE, indicates the Mobile Threat Defense partner may collect metadata about installed applications from Intune for IOS devices. When FALSE, indicates the Mobile Threat Defense partner may not collect metadata about installed applications from Intune for IOS devices. Default value is FALSE.
