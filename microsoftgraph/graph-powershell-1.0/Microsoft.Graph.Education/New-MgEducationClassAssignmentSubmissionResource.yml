  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphEducationSubmissionResource>`: educationSubmissionResource
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AssignmentResourceUrl <String>]`: Pointer to the assignment from which this resource was copied. If this is null, the student uploaded the resource.
    - `[Resource <IMicrosoftGraphEducationResource>]`: educationResource
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[CreatedBy <IMicrosoftGraphIdentitySet>]`: identitySet

  `INPUTOBJECT <IEducationIdentity>`: Identity Parameter
    - `[EducationAssignmentId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationAssignment
    - `[EducationAssignmentResourceId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationAssignmentResource
    - `[EducationCategoryId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationCategory
    - `[EducationClassId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationClass
    - `[EducationOutcomeId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationOutcome
    - `[EducationRubricId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationRubric
    - `[EducationSchoolId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSchool
    - `[EducationSubmissionId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSubmission
    - `[EducationSubmissionResourceId <String>]`: The unique identifier of educationSubmissionResource
