### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Publish an education assignment.
  Change the state of an educationAssignment from its original `draft` status to the `published` status.
  You can change the state from `draft` to `scheduled` if the **assignment** is scheduled for a future date.
  Only a teacher in the class can make this call.
  When an assignment is in draft status, students will not see the assignment, nor will there be any submission objects.
  Calling this API creates educationSubmission objects and displays the assignment in each student's list.
  The state of the assignment goes back to `draft` if there is any backend failure during publish process.
  To update the properties of a published **assignment**, see update an assignment.
