    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AppDisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the app for which consent is requested. Required. Supports $filter (eq only) and $orderby.

    - `[PendingScopes <IMicrosoftGraphAppConsentRequestScope[]>]`: A list of pending scopes waiting for approval. Required.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The name of the scope.
    - `[UserConsentRequests <IMicrosoftGraphUserConsentRequest[]>]`: A list of pending user consent requests. Supports $filter (eq).
