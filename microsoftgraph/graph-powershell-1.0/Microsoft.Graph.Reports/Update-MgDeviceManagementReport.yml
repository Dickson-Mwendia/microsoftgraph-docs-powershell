  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementReports>`: Singleton entity that acts as a container for all reports functionality.
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[ExportJobs <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExportJob[]>]`: Entity representing a job to export a report
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[ExpirationDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Time that the exported report expires
      - `[Filter <String>]`: Filters applied on the report
      - `[Format <DeviceManagementReportFileFormat?>]`: Possible values for the file format of a report
      - `[LocalizationType <DeviceManagementExportJobLocalizationType?>]`: Configures how the requested export job is localized
      - `[ReportName <String>]`: Name of the report
      - `[RequestDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Time that the exported report was requested
      - `[Select <String[]>]`: Columns selected from the report
      - `[SnapshotId <String>]`: A snapshot is an identifiable subset of the dataset represented by the ReportName. A sessionId or CachedReportConfiguration id can be used here. If a sessionId is specified, Filter, Select, and OrderBy are applied to the data represented by the sessionId. Filter, Select, and OrderBy cannot be specified together with a CachedReportConfiguration id.
      - `[Status <DeviceManagementReportStatus?>]`: Possible statuses associated with a generated report
      - `[Url <String>]`: Temporary location of the exported report

  `EXPORTJOBS <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementExportJob[]>`: Entity representing a job to export a report
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[ExpirationDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Time that the exported report expires
    - `[Filter <String>]`: Filters applied on the report
    - `[Format <DeviceManagementReportFileFormat?>]`: Possible values for the file format of a report
    - `[LocalizationType <DeviceManagementExportJobLocalizationType?>]`: Configures how the requested export job is localized
    - `[ReportName <String>]`: Name of the report
    - `[RequestDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Time that the exported report was requested
    - `[Select <String[]>]`: Columns selected from the report
    - `[SnapshotId <String>]`: A snapshot is an identifiable subset of the dataset represented by the ReportName. A sessionId or CachedReportConfiguration id can be used here. If a sessionId is specified, Filter, Select, and OrderBy are applied to the data represented by the sessionId.
