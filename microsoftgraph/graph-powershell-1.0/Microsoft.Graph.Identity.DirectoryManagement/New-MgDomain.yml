### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Adds a domain to the tenant.
  **Important**: You cannot use an associated domain with your Azure AD tenant until ownership is verified.
  See List verificationDnsRecords for details.
  Root domains require verification.
  For example, contoso.com requires verification.
  If a root domain is verified, subdomains of the root domain are automatically verified.
  For example, subdomain.contoso.com is automatically be verified if contoso.com has been verified.

  COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

  To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


  `BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphDomain>`: domain
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
    - `[AuthenticationType <String>]`: Indicates the configured authentication type for the domain. The value is either Managed or Federated. Managed indicates a cloud managed domain where Azure AD performs user authentication. Federated indicates authentication is federated with an identity provider such as the tenant's on-premises Active Directory via Active Directory Federation Services. Not nullable.
    - `[AvailabilityStatus <String>]`: This property is always null except when the verify action is used. When the verify action is used, a domain entity is returned in the response. The availabilityStatus property of the domain entity in the response is either AvailableImmediately or EmailVerifiedDomainTakeoverScheduled.
    - `[DomainNameReferences <IMicrosoftGraphDirectoryObject[]>]`: The objects such as users and groups that reference the domain ID. Read-only, Nullable. Supports $expand and $filter by the OData type of objects returned. For example /domains/{domainId}/domainNameReferences/microsoft.graph.user and /domains/{domainId}/domainNameReferences/microsoft.graph.group.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time when this object was deleted. Always null when the object hasn't been deleted.
    - `[FederationConfiguration <IMicrosoftGraphInternalDomainFederation[]>]`: Domain settings configured by a customer when federated with Azure AD. Supports $expand.
      - `[IssuerUri <String>]`: Issuer URI of the federation server.
      - `[MetadataExchangeUri <String>]`: URI of the metadata exchange endpoint used for authentication from rich client applications.
      - `[PassiveSignInUri <String>]`: URI that web-based clients are directed to when signing in to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) services.
      - `[PreferredAuthenticationProtocol <String>]`: authenticationProtocol
      - `[SigningCertificate <String>]`: Current certificate used to sign tokens passed to the Microsoft identity platform. The certificate is formatted as a Base64 encoded string of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing certificate and must be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class.   This property is used in the following scenarios:  if a rollover is required outside of the autorollover update a new federation service is being set up  if the new token signing certificate isn't present in the federation properties after the federation service certificate has been updated.   Azure AD updates certificates via an autorollover process in which it attempts to retrieve a new certificate from the federation service metadata, 30 days before expiry of the current certificate. If a new certificate isn't available, Azure AD monitors the metadata daily and will update the federation settings for the domain when a new certificate is available.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the identity provider.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[ActiveSignInUri <String>]`: URL of the endpoint used by active clients when authenticating with federated domains set up for single sign-on in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Corresponds to the ActiveLogOnUri property of the Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings MSOnline v1 PowerShell cmdlet.
      - `[FederatedIdpMfaBehavior <String>]`: federatedIdpMfaBehavior
      - `[IsSignedAuthenticationRequestRequired <Boolean?>]`: If true, when SAML authentication requests are sent to the federated SAML IdP, Azure AD will sign those requests using the OrgID signing key. If false (default), the SAML authentication requests sent to the federated IdP are not signed.
      - `[NextSigningCertificate <String>]`: Fallback token signing certificate that is used to sign tokens when the primary signing certificate expires. Formatted as Base64 encoded strings of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing certificate. Needs to be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class. Much like the signingCertificate, the nextSigningCertificate property is used if a rollover is required outside of the auto-rollover update, a new federation service is being set up, or if the new token signing certificate is not present in the federation properties after the federation service certificate has been updated.
      - `[PromptLoginBehavior <String>]`: promptLoginBehavior
      - `[SignOutUri <String>]`: URI that clients are redirected to when they sign out of Azure AD services. Corresponds to the LogOffUri property of the Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings MSOnline v1 PowerShell cmdlet.

        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.

    - `[IsDefault <Boolean?>]`: true if this is the default domain that is used for user creation. There is only one default domain per company. Not nullable
    - `[IsInitial <Boolean?>]`: true if this is the initial domain created by Microsoft Online Services (companyname.onmicrosoft.com). There is only one initial domain per company. Not nullable
    - `[IsRoot <Boolean?>]`: true if the domain is a verified root domain. Otherwise, false if the domain is a subdomain or unverified. Not nullable
    - `[IsVerified <Boolean?>]`: true if the domain has completed domain ownership verification. Not nullable
    - `[Manufacturer <String>]`: 
    - `[Model <String>]`: 
    - `[PasswordNotificationWindowInDays <Int32?>]`: Specifies the number of days before a user receives notification that their password will expire. If the property is not set, a default value of 14 days will be used.
    - `[PasswordValidityPeriodInDays <Int32?>]`: Specifies the length of time that a password is valid before it must be changed. If the property is not set, a default value of 90 days will be used.
    - `[ServiceConfigurationRecords <IMicrosoftGraphDomainDnsRecord[]>]`: DNS records the customer adds to the DNS zone file of the domain before the domain can be used by Microsoft Online services. Read-only, Nullable. Supports $expand.

      - `[Operation <String>]`: Type of asynchronous operation. The values can be ForceDelete or Verification
