      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[Checklist <IMicrosoftGraphPlannerChecklistItems>]`: plannerChecklistItems
        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[Description <String>]`: Description of the task.
      - `[PreviewType <String>]`: plannerPreviewType
      - `[References <IMicrosoftGraphPlannerExternalReferences>]`: plannerExternalReferences
        - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[DueDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time at which the task is due. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z
    - `[HasDescription <Boolean?>]`: Read-only. Value is true if the details object of the task has a non-empty description and false otherwise.
    - `[OrderHint <String>]`: Hint used to order items of this type in a list view. The format is defined as outlined here.
    - `[PercentComplete <Int32?>]`: Percentage of task completion. When set to 100, the task is considered completed.
    - `[PlanId <String>]`: Plan ID to which the task belongs.
    - `[PreviewType <String>]`: plannerPreviewType
    - `[Priority <Int32?>]`: Priority of the task. The valid range of values is between 0 and 10, with the increasing value being lower priority (0 has the highest priority and 10 has the lowest priority).  Currently, Planner interprets values 0 and 1 as 'urgent', 2, 3 and 4 as 'important', 5, 6, and 7 as 'medium', and 8, 9, and 10 as 'low'.  Additionally, Planner sets the value 1 for 'urgent', 3 for 'important', 5 for 'medium', and 9 for 'low'.
    - `[ProgressTaskBoardFormat <IMicrosoftGraphPlannerProgressTaskBoardTaskFormat>]`: plannerProgressTaskBoardTaskFormat
      - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique idenfier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[OrderHint <String>]`: Hint value used to order the task on the progress view of the task board. For details about the supported format, see Using order hints in Planner.
    - `[ReferenceCount <Int32?>]`: Number of external references that exist on the task.
    - `[StartDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time at which the task starts. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z
    - `[Title <String>]`: Title of the task.
